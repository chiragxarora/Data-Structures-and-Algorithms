A linked list is similar to an array but comes with a few advantages over arrays!
Its a linear data structure just like arrays!
LL => A collection of nodes which store some data!
Advantages : 
Memory need not be contigous in case of linked list, nodes of LL can be present anywhere in memory and still be connected
Insertions, deletions at random positions is not a costly operation like in arrays!
Implementation of other ds like stack, queue is much easier with linkedlist

LinkedList is a linear connection of nodes, in which each node contains two things,
 -> node value (current node value)
 -> next (pointer to the address of next node)

A ll as whole has 2 pointers, a head and a tail, head is the address of starting location, tail is the address of ending location
